          <p className="mb-6">Hi, I&apos;m Amit,</p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            a web developer from India passionate about designing and building
            web applications that people love to use.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            With over a year of experience, I&apos;ve developed various
            applications that have collectively attracted more than 3,000
            visitors—and counting! In addition to development, I often design
            applications from scratch, ensuring they are both functional and
            visually appealing.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Currently, I&apos;m working on BuildnPlay, a platform that gamifies
            the “building in public” process, helping users stay motivated and
            engaged as they work on their projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ever need assistance with development or design, feel free to
            reach out—I&apos;m happy to chat and help!
